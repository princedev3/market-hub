          Chances are there wasnt collaboration, communication, and checkpoints,
          there wasn&apos;t a process agreed upon or specified with the
          granularity required. It&apos;s content strategy gone awry right from
          the start. Forswearing the use of Lorem Ipsum wouldn&apos;t have
          helped, won&apos;t help now. It&apos;s like saying you&apos;re a bad
          designer, use less bold text, don&apos;t use italics in every other
          paragraph. True enough, but that&apos;s not all that it takes to get
          things back on track. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to
          get that Frankenstein You made all the required mock ups for
          commissioned layout, got all the approvals, built a tested code base
          or had them built, you decided on a content management system, got a
          license for it or adapted: The toppings you may chose for that TV
          dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you
          may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But
          what about your daily bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframesâ€”will
          your clients accept that you go about things the facile way?
          Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain terms that Lorem
          Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever.
